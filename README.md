# Employee Tracker Database

## About
For this application, I created an employee database using MYSQL2, Node.js, console.table and Inquirer. The database contains three tables: departments, roles, and employee. Users run the application from the command line. When run using the command: `node index.js` they may interact with the database in a few ways:

  View all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role 

When a view option is selected, console.table will display the selected table from the database in your terminal. After conpleting and action you are redirected to the main questions. To exit the application use `Ctrl+c`
