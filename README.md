# Employee Tracker Database

## About
For this application, I created an employee database using MYSQL2, Node.js, console.table and Inquirer. The database contains three tables: departments, roles, and employee. Users run the application from the command line in their terminal. This application is run using the command: `node index.js` and  users may interact with the database in a few ways:

  View all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role 

When a view option is selected, console.table will display the selected table from the database in your terminal. After completing an action, users are redirected to the main list of questions. To exit the application, type `CTRL+C`.
